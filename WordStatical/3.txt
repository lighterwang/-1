Nowadays, with the development of Internet, people count on the Internet to do a lot of things. The most common thing is to follow the
information they are interested in. Most people like to write down their comments, while as there is no law to limit the comment. I always see
thenegative words. Internet has become a main way for people to attack others. So horrible it is. We should be a wise person. The way we respect
others decides what kind of person we are. It is unwise to follow the bad comment and attack others. We need to have our own judgment and be
a nice person.
